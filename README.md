# Myportfolio
 
 My first portfolio project! Honestly it was difficult. Treehouse's project difficulty was a pendulum. The last project (8) was my high for the whole course, and then getting to the portfolio was a bit jarring as I had no idea on how i wanted to present myself or my information. Bootstrap was just introduced to us so I had some initial difficulty adjusting to the outside "code". But the hardest part was the creative side. I made the mistake of going straight to coding. no wireframes, no plans. 
 
  1. I made poor design choices on the landing. Very little visual hierarchy was present and I had photos not contributing any useful information about my work or myself. 
 2. Once I got past the creative block, and having no plan I found just getting things onto the page was helping with my design and highlighting what I liked and didn't like.
 3. My creative juices were writing checks my coding skills couldn't cash in. So keeping my goals and design choices to things I knew was important after wasting lots of time with svg illustrations for a background.
 4. I found once I had the general picture of how I wanted everything to look it all just kind of naturally fell into place which dissolved some the overwhelming and unsure feelings which really bogged me down at the beginning of the project.
